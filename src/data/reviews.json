    "review": "I could not be happier with the job Canyon did on my Mercedes! His eye for detail is spot on. He went above and beyond, I’m still in disbelief he got most all the blue stain out of my leather. He was on time, worked hard the entire time, and was extremely professional. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him, and I plan to hire him again when the car is ready for another detail. Thank you!"

    "review": "He did a great job. He showed up at 8:30 and I asked him to wrap it up around 3:30 because I needed to head to my golf league. He may have stayed all night to make sure it was perfect. Very reasonable rates for 7-passenger SUV. Still smells great 2 weeks later."

    "review": "Canyon is such a nice gentleman and one of those young businessman that you feel you have to spread the word around so he can continue to succeed. He made my 08 Volvo almost new again. I was stunned at how it came out. I’m no longer embarrassed about my vehicle. Great to work with, fair in price and gives you options to fit your budget. Great job Canyon!  Carolyn"
